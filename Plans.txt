Plans:

- Clash Royale Inspired
- Fog of war implemented
- Units spawned in the regions near owned buildings
- buildings can be taken over to be controlled by one side
- units follow a set of nodes in each lane, when unit has no target it finds nearest: Node, Enemy, or Building
- NODES PASS NEXT NODE TO UNITS -> this means they dont need to scan for nearest node as often
- minions automaticaly spawn at no cost to players
- larger units can be spawned by the player
- bases have modularity, things like towers can be added (NO CHOICE ON WHAT TO BUILD FOR NOW)

Game Manager:
- knows what it can spawn
- Manages wave spawners
- Manages whether a player has won
- checks whether neutral zones are neutral

Entities:
- Things they need to know
	-how much damage does it do?

	-destroy self only at max range
-what does a splash damage projectile need to know / do?
	-radius of splash damage

-navigation order
	-are we already following an enemy or building?
	-is there an enemy/building nearby?
	-is there a node we are already following?
	-have we gotten too close to the nearby node?
	-is there a node nearby?
