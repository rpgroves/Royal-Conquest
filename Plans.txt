Plans:

- Clash Royale Inspired
- Fog of war implemented
- Units spawned in the regions near owned buildings
- buildings can be taken over to be controlled by one side
- units follow a set of nodes in each lane, when unit has no target it finds nearest: Node, Enemy, or Building
- NODES PASS NEXT NODE TO UNITS -> this means they dont need to scan for nearest node as often
- minions automaticaly spawn at no cost to players
- larger units can be spawned by the player
- bases have modularity, things like towers can be added (NO CHOICE ON WHAT TO BUILD FOR NOW)

Home Screen Ideas:
- start out in a tavern or castle
- there is a character you can talk to that will point you towards the gameplay
- there is a tutorial zone, gameplay zone, exit game zone, and credits zone
- walking into a zone will trigger the next scene

Game mode ideas:
- invasion: move through a map where the enemy owns all territory and you must
work through a single lane capturing checkpoints, enemy cannot recpature land but there is a time limit
- conquest: classic clash royale clone where there are lanes you must push to destroy the enemy base
- resource battle: no enemy castle, but you have to deplete enemy tickets before yours
- gold rush: make more money than the enemy (neutrals, neutral bases (that can respawn), neutral camps
enemies, enemy bases, all are worth money)

Game Manager:
- knows what it can spawn
- Manages wave spawners
- Manages whether a player has won
- checks whether neutral zones are neutral

Entities:
- Things they need to know
	-how much damage does it do?
	-how much health does it have?
	-what color am I? (red if taking damage?)

Projectiles:
- Types
	-tracking (goes only into the enemy targeted)
	-piercing (goes towards first then continues until x distance)
	-splash damage (goes into enemy targetted then damages enemies around it)
-what do they need to know/do? (base to inherit from)
	-target object (maybe tag?)
	-damage to deal
	-have i hit the target?
	-aim itself towards target
	-move itself torwards target
	-destroy self on hit
-what does a piercing one need to know/do?
	-nothing special outside the base
-what does a piercing one need to know/do?
	-max range after hitting the target
	-needs to continue straight after hitting target, do damage to all enemy entities
	-destroy self only at max range
-what does a splash damage projectile need to know / do?
	-radius of splash damage
	-hit scan splash area, similar to how melee checks its surronudings
	-destroy self after damage dealt

Units:
- things they need to store
	-where are they current going?
	-are they currently targeting something?
	-What animation am i playing
	-what weapon am i holding (is it melee or ranged?)
	-what is near me? (scan for entities, buildings, nodes)

-navigation order
	-are we already following an enemy or building?
	-is there an enemy/building nearby?
	-is there a node we are already following?
	-have we gotten too close to the nearby node?
	-is there a node nearby?
