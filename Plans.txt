Plans:

- Clash Royale Inspired
- Fog of war implemented
- Units spawned in the regions near owned buildings
- buildings can be taken over to be controlled by one side
- units follow a set of nodes in each lane, when unit has no target it finds nearest: Node, Enemy, or Building
- NODES PASS NEXT NODE TO UNITS -> this means they dont need to scan for nearest node as often
- minions automaticaly spawn at no cost to players
- larger units can be spawned by the player
- bases have modularity, things like towers can be added (NO CHOICE ON WHAT TO BUILD FOR NOW)
